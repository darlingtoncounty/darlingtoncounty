👋 Hey, y'all! I’m Laurin Manning Gandy. <br><br>
🌙 I live in South Carolina. <br><br>
👶 This is my first repository. <br><br>
🐾 I love my dog, Brodie. <br><br>
📚 Currently I'm studying social sciences. <br><br>
🇺🇸 I've spent my career working in politics and digital communications. I'm too old for campaign life, but I still enjoy tinkering with technology, so I'd like to learn a thing or two around here. My tinkering days date back to Angelfire. I hope this will give me some street cred. But, yeah, you'd think I'd be better at it by now! 😂<br> <br>
